The goal for this project is to create a minesweeper game that gives you a time limit based off of how many flags you have checked. The more flags you create, the less time you have to make your next move.
seconds per turn = 15 * (.9 ^ flags_set)

How fast can you complete the board while limiting the amount of visual aids you have?
